			Floribella is 27 year old who is currently attending a development bootcamp. When she is not attending the bootcamp she is
			communiting to work via bicycle or bus, cooking, taking care of her sister, and playing with her four dogs. The mayority of her
			time is spent with her dogs since taking care of 4 dogs requires a lot of work and attention. Floribella has been a dog lover ever since she could
			remember. She is the go to person for when her friends/family have lost their dog or have found a dog. She has also encountered lost dogs herself
			in which she takes into her house until the owner appears. But due to her busy days she is unable to help every dog she encounters.
